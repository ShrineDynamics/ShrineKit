- Physics-based movement
	- Rigidbody movement
	- Physics body has effect on environment, environment has effect on body
	- Object step-up
	- Slope standing and good slope movement
		- Slope magnetism? (Moving down a slope/stairs pulls you towards it)
- Jumping
	- Air control
	- Holding space longer to jump higher (?)
	- Jump Buffering (buffer to register a jump press *before* hitting ground)
	- Coyote Time (buffer to register a jump press *just after* leaving ground)
	- Should provide opposite down-force on thing stood upon
- Dashing
- Sprinting
- Crouch sliding
	- Maintain momentum when crouching post-sprint?
	- Add burst of momentum?
- Ledge Climbing
- Slope sliding
	- When standing on a slope that is too steep to stand on, slide down it (physics might take care of this already?)
- Crouching
	- Dynamic crouch height
	- Crouch anticipation
	- Visual crouch spring for cam
- Dynamic FP Camera
	- Spring for vertical movement
	- Directional tilt/lean
	- Velocity FOV scaling
	- Screen effects for rapid velocity, crouching, etc.
	- Procedural head bobbing effect
	- Ledge climb 'animation'
- FP tool rendering
	- Overlay cam
	- Tool sway effect
	- Sync FOV with main
	- Somehow sync lighting / multi-layer shadow casting
- Footstep audio
